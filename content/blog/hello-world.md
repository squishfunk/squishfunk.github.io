Welcome to my portfolio! This is my very first blog post.

Here, I plan to share my thoughts on **web development**, **design**, and the **tech industry**.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a clean, fast, and minimalist space to showcase my work and share my knowledge. Using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** allowed me to build exactly what I envisioned: a simple, static site that loads instantly.

### Tech Stack used:
- **Next.js 16**: For static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: For utility-first styling.
- **Markdown**: For writing content easily.
- **GitHub Pages**: For free, fast hosting.

Stay tuned for more!
